            <h1>Client-Server Computing</h1> <br>
            
            <h4><b>What is client-server computing?</b></h4>
            <p>Client-Server computing is a model architecture on the web that splits computers 
              into two sections—clients and servers. Computers that ask for and request services 
              are called clients, and computers that serve clients are called servers.
            </p><br>
            <p>Clients can be a machine or program, like a laptop, mobile, desktop etc.<br>
              A client program is a program that allows the user to make a request, 
              such as a web browser, word processor, or photo editing software.
            </p><br>
            <p>Servers are powerful computers dedicated to managing disk drivers (file servers), 
              printers (print servers), or network traffic (network servers).<br>
              A single server can serve multiple clients at the same time, 
              and run multiple servers on one single machine. They are called virtual servers. 
              “Apache – Serves HTTP request, and Database Servers runs a database management 
              system such as My SQL and other types of servers.”<sup>[9]</sup>
            </p><br>

            <h4><b>Uses of client-server computing</b></h4>
            <p>The web is a service which is built on top of the internet to allow computers to 
              share and exchange data smoothly and reliably.<br>
              Data includes images, videos, documents etc. in any form and for that sometimes 
              the web is referred to as a client-server model because there are always computers 
              that ask for data which are called clients and the computers that give the data 
              are servers.
            </p>
            <img class="client-server-computing-img" src="/img/client-server-computing.png" alt="Figure 1. Client Server Computing. (Meador, 2018).">
            <p><i>Figure 1. Client Server Computing. (Meador, 2018).</i> <sup>[6]</sup></p>
            <br>
            <p>In the image above, you can see the clients requesting data through the internet 
              to the server. The server then gathers the data to the client who is requesting 
              and response back.<br>
              The data is then printed on the client's screen.
            </p><br>

            <h4><b>Why has client-server evolved</b></h4>
            <p>“<i>Client-server computing used to be just a mainframe connecting to dumb terminals.”</i><sup>[9]</sup><br>
              Since then, technology has evolved. The capacity of personal computers was 
              largely ignored, many companies started to think about sharing, or splitting, 
              any of the processing demands between the client, and the mainframe.<br>
              Client-server technology evolved out of this for better computing control 
              and more computing value. It is a way for which software components interact 
              to form a system that can be for multiple users.<sup>[1]</sup>
            </p><br>

            <h4><b>Advantages and Disadvantages</b></h4>
            <p>Clients on a client-server architecture can be thin or fat. 
              Thin clients are a computer program or application that depends on 
              another computer (server). The client is responsible for running the 
              presentation software.<br>
              A fat client is a computer or network that provides the functionality to 
              a central server. E.g. STMP, FTP, DNS server. This runs some or all of the 
              application logic.<sup>[3]</sup>

            <p><u>Advantages and disadvantages</u></p>
            <p>Thin advantages, thick disadvantages:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Reduces hardware and software maintenance.</li>
              <li>Lesser security vulnerability.</li>
            </ol> 
            <p>Thick advantages, thin disadvantages:</p>
