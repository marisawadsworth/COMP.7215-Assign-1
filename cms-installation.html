            <h1>CMS Installation</h1> <br>
            
            <h4><b>Joomla</b></h4>
            <p>For this assignment, I used cPanel provided by Toi Ohomai to download Joomla. 
              It was fast and easy to install. Joomla was written in PHP.<br>
              The content for the website is stored in the cPanel database.<br><br>
              There were no themes. It was difficult to use and find my way around the website. 
              I needed to use learning resources before I could start creating a website. 
              The format was strange. When you edit a page, the content is everywhere and not structured. 
              If you're copying and pasting a text from somewhere else, you will need to re-format 
              it on the page.<br><br>
              To add plug-ins you click Extensions, then Plugins. There is a range of plug-ins, 
              all you need to do is enable the plug-in by pressing the red cross to a green 
              tick by its name, you can also click on the name of the plug-in, it will take 
              you to its setting where you can configure it.<br>
              The modules page shows a list of features on your website and where they are placed.<br><br>
              <u>Here is a link to the website:</u><br>
              <a href="https://10002444.2020.labnet.nz/joomla30/">Joomla Website - Avocado Gold</a>
            </p><br>

            <h4><b>Google Sites</b></h4>
            <p>I used Google Sites as the other CMS. There was no installation for this 
              CMS as everything was online. Google was written in Java and Python.<br>
              The content for the website is stored in your Google Drive.<br><br>
              It was easy to find a theme. There are three tabs at the top saying “Insert”, 
              “Pages”, and “Themes” all of them are free. Click on the theme you want, and 
              it loads onto the screen.<br><br>
              To find the plug-ins go to the insert page and scroll to the bottom, most of 
              the plug-ins are from Google itself with Google docs, slides, sheets, forms, 
              charts. The others are embedded by YouTube, Maps etc. It was easy to use these 
              plug-ins. You just click on the plug-in you want, and it asks you to select a 
              file from your Google Drive to add to the website, or to add a link.<br><br>
              Google Sites is just a drag and drop what you want onto your website. 
              It was simple to use.<br><br>
              <i>(You need to be signed into your Toi Ohomai Google Email to see the website).</i><br><br>
