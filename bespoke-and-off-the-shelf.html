            <h4><b>What is a CMS?</b></h4>
            <p>Content Management System (CMS) is a software application that can manage 
              digital content.<sup>[9]</sup> It is an easy way of creating a website from scratch with 
              little experience in coding. Instead of creating a website using HTML, CSS, 
              JavaScript, then creating the backend, then all the administration interfaces 
              to log into your website, and updating the information on your website. 
              You can download a CMS, and it does it for you.<br>
              You can set up a website if you're a software developer, but the website 
              wouldn't be easy to use for someone with no experience. If you're building 
              a website for someone or a company who are not familiar with technology or 
              has no coding experience than it is better to use a CMS. The CMS provides all 
              the tools to manage users, content, and apply available layouts to your websites. 
              This include's blogs, businesses, e-commerce, portfolios, social media, 
              landing pages, etc. There are many popular CMS, to use including, WordPress, 
              Joomla, Wix, Squarespace, and so many more. <br>
              Most of these CMS include plug-ins. Plug-ins can be used for anything they're 
              a feature installed in the CMS to use on your website. You can get plug-ins 
              that show your social media, pop-ups, emailing, create memberships for 
              your users who visit the site, CEO for traffic to your website, etc. <br>
              CMS also can include themes. WordPress, for example, has thousands of themes 
              to choose from, for different layout and designs for your website. 
              Themes are free or paid.<br>
              You can create a website, in no time at all with little effort, and no 
              coding experience. Some CMS' have an open-source application so you can 
              code and modify themes or styles or hire someone to do it for you.

            </p><br>

            <p>Here are some examples.</p>
            <p><b>Download.</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Wordpress</li>
              <li>Joomla</li>

            </ul>

            </ul>

            <br><h4><b>What they are used for?</b></h4>
            <p>CMS’s are for users with little coding experience to create websites 
              in minutes/hours. It’s a basic and fast way to include paragraphs, images, 
              and videos in a website and gets stored in the database. Users can drag and 
              drop items into a webpage when needed with no coding required.
            </p><br>

            <p>CMS’ are static website; this means the website contains fixed web pages 
              with fixed content that doesn’t move. Statics websites work great for small 
              websites, but it can make a large website hard to maintain. Large websites 
              usually use dynamic pages, which can be updated by modifying a database.<br>
              Static sites that do contain a lot of pages are often designed with a 
              template/theme. This makes it possible to update several pages at once and 
              helps provide a nice layout throughout the website.<sup>[8]</sup>
            </p><br>

            <h4><b>Installing CMS?</b></h4>
            <p>To install a CMS there are many different ways. If you're using a hosting 
              provider, they may already have a database for the CMS you want to install. 
              A popular CMS that is provided to many hosting providers is WordPress.<br>
              You can also create a database manually using other tools like phpMyAdmin, 
              Plesk, cPanel, and MySQL Client.<br>
              If you already have a database and it is in use, you can install the CMS in it. 
              You just need to make sure you have a prefix for your tables to avoid over-writing 
              any existing database tables.<sup>[13]</sup>
            </p><br>

            <p>The online CMS’s cannot be downloaded on your PC, and can only be accessed on the web.</p>
