                  Joomla was the result of a fork of Mambo when it was released. 
                  The Mambo name was a trademark of Mico International Pvt. Ltd, who 
                  formed a non-profit foundation.<br>
                  On September 22, the name was changed to Joomla after developers created 
                  a website called OpenSourceMatters.org to distribute information to the 
                  software community.
                  </td> 
                <td>Google Sites was first released on the 28th of February 2008.<br>
                  Google Sites started as JotSpot, the name of a software company that offers 
                  enterprise software.<br>
                  It was founded by Joe Kraus and Graham Spencer, co-founders of Excite.
